## Welcome to the Github landing page for AI & Robotics Estonia! 
AIRE is a technology hub dedicated to making Estonian manufacturing more competitive by helping businesses to introduce artificial intelligence and robotics solutions. Instead of developing digitalization solutions in-house, AIRE matches ‚Äúsolution providers‚Äù and ‚Äúproblem owners‚Äù, and facilitates cooperation between these two parties. 

Our clients are Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector (< 250 employees) who may not have their own R&D departments. In effect, SMEs contract out their R&D to researchers and professors, with AIRE as the facilitator of this interaction. For innovators who have developed a method of streamlining manufacturing processes with AI and robotics but do not yet know which clients to sell their product to, AIRE is the perfect organization to pair developers with companies in need of their product.

Here, you will find repositories for the various projects that our partners in academia have worked on, with technical as well as simplified documentation. The projects included in this page are open-access, as opposed to open-source, so feel free to poke around! Contact us at info@aire-edih.eu.
